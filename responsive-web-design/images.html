        <h2>HTML Images</h2>
        <p>Use of images make our websites engaging and helps with the esthetics of the design. Images are used for displaying logos, products, team members, store and more.

            Unlike word or other documents we do not embed images into our HTML document rather we link to the image in our HTML</p>

            <h2>The Image Element</h2>
            <p>The HTML element to display an image on the webpage is <code>img</code> which is a singular tag.</p>
<p>
                The <code>img</code> tag needs two pieces of information one which image to link to and two a short description of the image.
            </p>
            <p>
                These two pieces of information are supplied to the <code>img</code> tag by using attributes. Attributes are additional information that can be added to an HTML element</p>
                <p>With the image we use the following attributes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><code>src</code>Source, is to provide the relative or absolute path to the image</li>
                    <li><code>alt</code>alternative text, to provide a description of the image for search engines, screen readers, and in case an image does not load</li>
                </ul>
                <img src="./images/html_image.png" alt="code for adding images">
                <h2>Additional Attributes</h2>
                <p><code>title</code> Title Attribute: We can also describe the image with a tooltip if the mouse is held over it for a few seconds. The tooltip text is populated from the title attribute</p>
                <p><code>img title="2 pandas on a slide" src="..."</code></p>
                <p><code>width</code>&<code>height</code>We can also set explicit widths and heights of an image overriding it's size of the image dimensions. </p>
