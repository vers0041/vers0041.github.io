Nadia Verso Portfolio

My goal after completion of the IMD program is to obtain a career in UX design or web design. I wanted my portfolio to be highly user friendly and aesthetic. I gained inspiration from ux design portfolios I found online. I made sure to ensure my portfolio pieces and contact page were easy to access and caught the user's attention easily. 

I first created my portfolio in Adobe XD. In XD I set my styles and styled my content for mobile, tablet, and web.

When first learning bootstrap I thought I would utilize it more for this assignment. However, I found the bootstrap styles did not match the style I was seeking. I wanted my portfolio to have a specific brand aesthetic that I could not create through Bootstrap. In conclusion, I did not use much bootstrap. 

I had issues with my top nav for mobile. I wanted the logo to be displayed at the top while the nav link names were displayed under. I thought this could should be done with grid. After seeking help from David he guided me to use flex which resulted in less code and much easier styling between dif screen views. 

As I began coding and saw my portfolio come to fruition I decided to make a couple style changes that I felt were more aesthetic and created more of my desired look.
