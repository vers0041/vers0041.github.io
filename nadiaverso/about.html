            <p>An Interactive Media Design student on a mission to <strong>improve user experience</strong> through
                beautiful and well thought out design.</p>
            <h3>Education</h3>
            <p>I am currently studying <strong>Interactive Media Design</strong>, in this program I am learning a
                variety of skills for digital media including <strong>graphic design, UX/UI, web design, design theory,
                    and design best practices</strong>. In my program we learn through hands-on projects with sample
                clients where we create design assets for them including branding, graphics, and responsive web sites.
            </p>
            <h3>UX/UI Design</h3>
            <p>I have studied UX design through <strong>project-based</strong> courses. This has given me a
                <strong>holistic view</strong> of the UX design process. I have had the opportunity to work with a
                variety of sample clients and projects. I enjoy that UX design focuses on the <strong>user</strong> and
                their goals and that the solutions are based on real human research. I enjoy creating <strong>beautiful,
                    functional redesigns</strong> and maximizing the potential of a product or service. </p>
            <h3>Responsive Web Design</h3>
            <p>I am learning <strong>responsive web design</strong> by creating a variety of sites that behave across a
                range of platforms. I use fluid design, media queries, CSS frame work and web animation to create fun,
                interactive and dynamic media projects. </p>
            <h3>BA Communications and Media Studies</h3>
            <p>In addition to learning Interactive Media Design, I have an <strong>Honours Degree in Communications and
                    Media Studies</strong>. Through this degree I have practiced my communications and analytical
                skills. I have excellent written and spoken clear communication skills paired with the ability to apply
                a systemic approach to communications projects.
            </p>
            <h3>Fun Facts</h3>
            <p>Outside of design, I love to <strong>travel, surf, spend time with my pup and spend time in
                    nature</strong> . I am passionate about living a sustainable life and giving back to the earth. I
                believe everything we need is found within nature and it is so important to be kind to the earth and all
                its beings. </p>
