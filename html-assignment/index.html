            <p>
                Hi, my name is <em>Nadia Versolato</em>. I am an <b>Interactive Media Design student</b> at Algonquin
                College in my 1<sup>st</sup> semmester of the program.
                I have an Honours Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Communications and Media studies and experience in copywriting
                and social media marketing.
                I chose the Interactive Media Design program because it will allow me to build and craft a variety of
                creative and technical skills for a career in the digital media industry. My ultimate goal is to
                freelance in web design and branding. I want to create my own brand and craft beautiful websites for
                like-minded clients!

            </p>
            <p>You can usually find me daydreaming about where I would like to travel next or practicing brand design on
                <abbr title="Adobe Illustrator">AI</abbr> in my free time. I love to travel, surf, do yoga, and hang out
                with my friends and family. My goal is to freelance so I can live by the beach, work remotely, travel
                while I work, and be my own boss. </p>
